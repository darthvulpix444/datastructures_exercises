# Stack and Queue Implementation in C++
This example contains a simple C++ implementation of a stack and a queue, along with a function to move items from a queue to a stack. The code showcases fundamental data structure concepts.

## Stack Class
The Stack class features basic stack operations, including push, pop, and isEmpty methods. It has a fixed size of 100 elements.

## Queue Class
The Queue class implements a basic queue with enqueue, dequeue, and isEmpty methods. Similar to the stack, it is limited to 100 elements.

## Queue to Stack Movement
The moveQueueToStack function demonstrates how to efficiently move items from a queue to a stack.

## Main Program
In the main function, a sample scenario is presented. Items are enqueued into a queue, then moved to a stack, and finally popped from the stack for display.
